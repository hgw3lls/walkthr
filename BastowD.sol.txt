The Secret of Bastow Manor
Gameworx Software (1983)
Walk Through by Dorothy Millard (C64 Version)


Notes:

1. The dogs will get you after a limited number of moves, so whenever
   you are in the open, be sure to take cover. There are three places
   where you are safe:
-  Climb the tree.
-  Climb the ladder at the window.
-  In the shed.

2. The safe combination is IBDF. This is worked out from the note in the
   box (reads VI) and the book in the library (locks and cunning
   escapes. as a general rule for opening treasure chests try Right 3,
   Left 7, Right 2. the rest of the page is missing).
-  Starting at F, the sixth letter (VI) and going right 3, you get to the
   9th letter, which is I (first letter in the combination).  
-  Left 7 takes you back to the second letter (9-7), which is B (second
   letter of the combination.  
-  Right 2 brings you to D (2+2).  
-  The F at the end is the starting letter ("the left is right. or is the
   right wrong").
