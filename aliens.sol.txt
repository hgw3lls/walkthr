"Space Aliens Laughed at my Cardigan" walk-through
This walk-through is based on ALIEN.WLK, which comes in the ZIP source
and is presumably by the author.

Feel free to write and upload a better solution if you want to.
Otherwise, corrective modifications to this solution
are welcomed and encouraged.

Note that to figure this out, I looked at the source to figure out
what you are supposed to do (due to bugs, you don't need to do
everything to `win').
My taking over starts where NORTH is instead written N.
Also, note the (unintentional?) tribute to Infocom's classic
`Guess the Verb' in Zork I, in the last line. What /do/ you do to a switch?
