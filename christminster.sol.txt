Part One -- Outside the Gates:
Look at cobblestones, get the stone, go north.
Give handbag to busker, give toffee to cop,
COP, GIVE TOFFEE TO BUSKER (do this just as the busker asks         +1 =1
for a small item), go break the window, get the feather,            +1 =2
go back and wait until the busker shows all the cups are 
empty, then go to the don, tickle him, get key, go back to          +1 =3
busker and give him the key when he asks for a small item.
After the arrest, get the key and open the gate.                    +2 =5
 
Part Two -- Inside the College:
Generally, explore what you can.
 
Porter's Lodge:
Show telegram to Porter, get key, look in Malcolm's pigeon          +1 =6
hole, read the note, look in Baskeyfield's pigeon hole, get
the copper key. [note is clue to book ZINOVIC]
There is a list of dons and addresses you can read.
 
Malcolm's Room:
Unlock A5, open door, E, S, open window, x ivy, put the lab         +1 =7
book in handbag, close the handbag.  Wait while the dons            +2 =9
discuss things.  Remember the phone call promised.  Go.
                                                    x map           +1 =10
Master:
Pull bell, U, show telegram to Master                               +1 =11
ask Master about dinner, all the names you read.                    +1 =12
He will tell you what interests Wilderspin and give you a book.
If you don't do it right, you get Flower Fairies.  Return it and 
try again.  You want Arkwright.  Ask Master about college.          +2 =14
Later:  Just walk in and use the phone.
 
Library:
Unlock the door with the copper key.  Look up Maclane and Zinovic   +1 =15
in the index.  Look up all names you find in both the index and
the Maclane. (look up = 1 pt each Lully, Zinovic, Maclane, God)     +4 =19
Zinovic will tell you how to decode the Lab Book.  The key word
is Christabel.  Maclane will give you clues to all the men.
Look up 143 in Arkwright            (Look up Hawksmoor = 1)         +1 =20
 
Wilderspin:
Knock on B2.  Show Arkwright to Wilderspin and he will let you in.  +1 =21
X the fireplace and the griffins.  Press ____ eye and it will
click.  Tell him to press (left or right) eye and you press the     +1 =22
other to open the passage.  Inside CLIMB WILDERSPIN, then tell      +1 =23
him to go south (WILDERSPIN, S), feel the walls.  You will find
a ledge and Wilderspin will climb up.  S to the Secret Room.
X flask and you will see a retort and a brown bottle.  Get them.
Look under the bench, pull lever, D -> Library.                     +1 =24
Wilderspin will stay in the Secret Room.  Look at the bottom
of the brown bottle and look up the name, Vauhan -> Vaughan
From the Lab Book: look up Lully 364
Wilderspin mentions Henry Garton.  Look up Garton in index.
Go back to Wilderspin's room and get your inventory back.
 
Cellars:
Note: have the brown bottle and/or read bottle to get the wine.
(Library: X Introitus Apertus -> explains spittle, gives date.
 look up all the men on the plaques and match date.)
 
Wait for cook to open hatch, D, hide in alcove, wait until cook
leaves, turn on light, exit alcove, search bin 3, get bottle.
(green bottle with pale liquid)  Knock on hatch, wait, knock.       +1  =25
Look under table in Dining Hall -> corkscrew.
[pale liquid is 'spittle' or 'Virgin's milk']
 
Edward:  Meet Edward and show feather, catch tears in brown bottle.
  (moggy (cat) will be Turmeric after Edward greets him)
 
Chapel:  Before 6pm, read the Latin Bible.  It mentions myrrh.
     (myrrheum is not mentioned in the English version)
     (look up john 11:43 per code in Lab book)
 
Bungay:  Edward has an appointment to discuss his thesis.  Tell
Edward to go to Bungay's Room (one direction at a time.  Author
says 'edward, wait' will work if needed.  Knock on Bungay's door
and go down.  He will take Edward in, then you can sneak in and     +1  =26
search his room.  Get the box (gum) and pull desk, enter gap,
x drawer, look in drawer, get chapbook.  2 points only, no clues.   +2  =28
exit, open window, N -> garden.  ['gum' is 
'myrrh']                                         +1  =29
 
Garden:  X bushes, NW, X door, put telegram* in crack, open door.   +1  =30
Enter shed.  Get steel key.  Cat is sitting on the bee veil.  S.
Pour pale liquid (green bottle) into retort (was empty), SE, go
to the river and fill the green bottle with water
or you can use the retort and pour the spittle later.  Return.
Throw water at cat, get the veil.
 * Mike says the ticket will work and perhaps other items.
 * Matthew adds that the pin will work (from the Library note).
 
Gate:  Unlock the gate with the steel key, open gate, SW.  Find
Edward and get him into the garden.
 
Arboretum with Edward:
Throw* (anything, I used the iron key) at parrot, S, enter punt,    +1 =31
wait.  Edward will pole to the other side.  Wear veil, exit.        +1 =32
 *alternate: SHAKE TREE added by Matthew.
 
Bee Hives:
SE -> Beehives -- open third hive and get honey in green bottle.
Note:  The spittle is in the retort, honey in the green bottle,
tears in the brown bottle and gum in the box.
[probably honey and tears can be in either bottle, but not retort]
[all ingredients must be separate until 'cooked'.]
S -> Earthen path -- get peanuts, N, NW -> East bank (Edward and
parrot).  Throw peanut at parrot.  Give peanut to Edward.           +1 =33
Enter punt, wait to get to other side, N (get the object back).

Phone call:  D into B Basement, open cabinet.  Unplug all the
wires and put the red and blue wires in the green socket.
Put the green wires in either red or blue.  You can test with
the meter to see which wires go to which people if you want.  
[attach clip to (color) wires.  +5 means connected]
Go to Master's House and enter.  DON'T PULL BELL.
Dial the Master's phone number.  (phone # 212)
You will hear the conversation--remember name, time and place.
Look up Walthamstowe*.                                              +1 =37
[*Mike's comment:
The name varies from game to game, from the following list:
Skery, Field, Hoskins, Pocock, Walthamstowe, Plumb,
Shepherd, and Winkler (it was Plumb when I played it). ]
[My friend saw Walthamstowe, too.  version 1; I did it at 3:30pm]
 
Elixir:
Recipe--look up 364 in Lully.  (retort contains spittle only)
Go to Edward's Room,  EDWARD, LIGHT RING.  Put the retort on the    +1 =38
ring, pour honey into retort, empty box into retort, pour tears*    +1 =39

Make your hat by tearing the veil.

Get decanter, give decanter to Wilderspin.                          +1 =43
All get up and go to Common Room.                               
 
Common Room:  get candle  (time is 10 pm)
 
Library:  Look up Waldenstowe (or ?) to get De Gloriae Coelestis
          Open De Gloriae Coelestis -> rusty key                    +1 =44
          Look up Hawksmoor -> courtyard
Note: for a point, climb the wistaria to the roof, D -> courtyard   +1 =45
 
Courtyard/manhole:
Unlock the manhole with the rusty key, open manhole, D              +1 =46

Pull Malcolm up stairs -> Top of Stairs
Kill Jarboe, unlock door with zinc key, open door.
Pull Malcolm north                                                Win = 50
 *I found zinc, but it may be random (silver or ?) or
 later versions may be different.
 
[Mike's comment:
For fun, look up Rees in Men of Balliol and the index.
You also may want to mention that the endgame is very tightly timed, 
with room for perhaps one mistake along the way.  ]
[My comment:
I am not sure about the ONE mistake, but save at the door and then
finish without interruption.]
