Russian Sects Part Three: Vissarion, the Siberian
Messiah
(RIA Novosti continues its six-part series on Russian sects and
fringe beliefs with an account of Scottish author Daniel Kalder's
visit to the Siberian hideaway of an ex-traffic cop and selfproclaimed messiah.)
Austin, Texas
June 16, 2009
Daniel Kalder
RIA Novosti
In the early 1990s Russia was awash with mystics, fortune tellers
and messiahs as the collapse of the Soviet Union had opened up
a Pandora's Box of hitherto forbidden beliefs.
After seven decades of state-supported atheism, all the world's
religious possibilities flooded the country at once, and in the
ensuing chaos thousands of men and women claimed to hear
messages from spiritual realms. Many of these seers simply
faded away, while a few such as the Ukrainian prophetess Maria
Devi Christos ended up engulfed in scandal, and then locked up
in jail.
One Messiah however has shown real staying power, and is
surely the most successful of the many Christs that were
wandering around Russia 18 years ago. He is the ex-traffic
policeman Sergei Torop, better known to his followers as
Vissarion Christ, who lives on top of a mountain in the southern
Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia. It is reported that between 4000
and 5000 followers live in villages scattered around the
mountain, while a further 50,000 follow his teachings in the
world beyond.
Born on January 14th 1961 in Krasnodar in Russia's south,
Torop's parents divorced when he was young. His mother took
him to the industrial town of Minussinsk in Siberia where he
grew up, and after completing his military service he became a
traffic policeman. However Torop was also a talented artist and
while painting an icon for a local church he experienced a
mystical vision which lasted for several months, after which he
realised that he was the Son of God. Donning red robes and

assuming the name Vissarion, he preached his first sermon on
the 18th August 1991. The charismatic Vissarion soon attracted
followers and led them to the mountain he now calls home.
There, equipped only with handheld saws and axes, they cut a
path to the top and erected a home for 'the Teacher'. A
community began to grow in the villages around the mountain.
Soon afterwards Vissarion spoke at a press conference revealing
to the world that he was the Messiah, come to reveal the Last
Testament to mankind.

About three years ago I travelled to Siberia to meet Vissarion for
a book I was writing. I was driven mainly by curiosity: I had
never met a Messiah before, and I also wanted to talk to the
people who had given up everything to follow him, to try and
understand their motivations. After a 2000 mile flight from
Moscow that passed through 4 time zones I arrived in Abakan, a
bleak industrial town close to Mongolia, and from there travelled
for hours through the flat, snow-covered Siberian landscape to
Petropavlovka, the 'capital village' of the Vissarionites.
Immediately I was in a different world, as Petropavlovka was
clean, orderly and contained lots of new buildings - unlike most
of the depressed and run down settlements I had passed through
en route. After some initial confusion (my contact had left the
village and so nobody knew I was coming) I was ushered into the
home of Tatiana Denisova, formerly the editor of a soviet
newspaper, now one of Vissarion's most devoted followers.
Tatiana explained to me that she had built her house, a dance
hall, and a girl's school with the proceeds from the sale of her
apartment in Moscow. Everybody who came to live in
Petropavlovka had to sell his house in order to pay for a home in
the new world: thus although money was banned in the
community, those who had been richest in their old life managed
to maintain some of their prosperity in their new life - and it also
makes it harder to leave, of course. The atmosphere was friendly
and open, though the portrait of a smiling Vissarion hanging on
the wall was a little unnerving.
Tatiana and her friend Rashid, an ex-Muslim from Tatarstan
stressed Vissarion's environmentalism. His teachings were about
living in harmony with nature, they said, and anyone was free to
live in the community so long as he agreed to respect the
community's rules, which included adherence to a strict vegan
diet, and a prohibition on alcohol and drugs. Most of the people
in the community came from the former Soviet Union, but there
were also some Bulgarians, Germans and a lone Belgian among
them. Contrary to the popular belief that sects appeal mainly to
the weak-willed and stupid, many of the people I met were
highly educated members of the professional classes: teachers,
scientists and artists, an astrophysicist from Cuba and there was
even a former deputy minister in the Belarussian government
living in the village. Tatiana's next door neighbour was Svetlana
Vladimirskaya, an extremely famous pop star from the mid1990s who had abandoned the world of fame and glamour to
follow Vissarion. All of them spoke in glowing terms about 'the
Teacher'. Once you heard the wisdom of his teachings, once you
met him, you just knew that he was the Son of God.

I spent a few days in Petropavlovka, speaking to people, and
marvelling at the smoothness of the operation - it was especially
surprising to find a state of the art media studio located inside a
traditional wooden Russian house. This was where the group
produced videos and DVD's that they used to proselytise
throughout Russia. These frequently depicted images of
beautiful Siberian meadows that looked like something out of a
Tolkien fantasy. They didn't show much of the snow and the
backbreaking toil required to live in isolation in Siberia however.
The most interesting person I met was 'Sergei' the village priest,
who in an earlier life had been a rocket scientist, officer in the
Red Army, and also one of the men who sat in a remote station
in the Far East waiting for the phone call from the Kremlin
instructing him to press the button that would start a nuclear
holocaust. Sergei saw the Vissarionites as continuing the Russian
tradition of religious non-conformism which had begun with the
schism of 1666. Since then the remote regions of the country
have always been home to a bewildering mix of apocalyptic Old
Believers, self- castrating Skopts, self-flagellating Khlysts and
many other movements which rejected the state and the official
church.
Sergei explained Vissarion's theology, assuring me that it
contained no contradictions and was completely reconciled with
science. It seemed to include a bit of everything - which is
appropriate as Vissarion claims to have come to unite all
religions. Here are just a few of the Teacher's ideas, which are
accepted as truth by his thousands of followers:
1) There are two Gods. The first created the universe and then
withdrew, leaving us to cause chaos. The second came into being
later and wants to help us.
2) Satan is created by our own negative energy. He and his
demons manipulate us into committing sinful deeds.
3) The earth is in the process of eradicating us for our
wickedness.
4) Moral perfection is possible and necessary. This can be
attained by studying and internalising Vissarion's Last
Testament, now incorporating ten fat volumes of moral and
metaphysical instruction.
5) If we do not perfect ourselves, then after the earth annihilates
us there will be no bodies left for us to reincarnate into; thus our
souls will whirl around the cosmos in torment forever.
Vissarion's community is ensuring that a small quantity of 'good
flesh' will survive the apocalypse so that the souls will have
somewhere to go.
Want to know more? Well, the sect's site has information in
English, and Sergei also recommended The Matrix as a good
illustration of their world view.

Nightline report on Vissarion of Siberia

Finally I received clearance to visit the Messiah. And so early one
morning I left Petropavlovka and travelled 40km offroad, before
trekking a further four kilometres on foot through the taiga to
the entrance of the 'Abode of Dawn'. This was the village where
250 of Vissarion's most devoted followers lived, working to build
a perfect 'city' of fourteen streets, radiating outwards from a
central point like a star. The Messiah lived above it all in a
wooden house at the highest stage of the mountain, with only his
family, secretary and a few servants to attend to his needs. A
guide met me at the entrance to the village and very soon I was
ascending the path for my audience with the Son of God.
Vissarion was standing when I entered the room, dressed in
white, nodding and smiling beatifically. He was tall and
imposing and looked a lot like pictures of Jesus Christ. His
personal secretary Vadim was at his side: in an earlier life, he
had been a member of the Russian rock band Integral, which
had performed at the groundbreaking Tbilisi Rock Festival 1980,
regarded as the 'Soviet Woodstock'. Now he attended to the
Messiah's every needs, and recorded his every public utterance
for possible inclusion in the Last Testament - which is why it's
ten volumes long and still growing.
I had read other interviews and knew that Vissarion got bored
easily. So I decided to speak to him as if he was who he claimed
to be: the Son of God. My first question was very open: 'What is
the most important thing for people who don't know what you
are doing here to understand?'
Vissarion paused, formulating his answer precisely. Then,
eyelids half-closed as if hypnotized, he replied in a soft, sing song voice that they should come and follow him if they hoped to
survive the coming global catastrophe.
'But it's difficult,' I said. 'You live so far away and hardly anyone
knows about your revelation. Why don't you come to the people
as Jesus did, and preach?'

They will find me, if their souls are ready.'

He shrugged, apparently unconcerned. Then he started
explaining parts of his theology but I already knew it all from the
priest. I then tried to find out if there was there any trace of
Sergei Torop, the ex- traffic policeman left in him, but those
questions led to a dead end. It was as if Torop was somebody
else he had known a long time ago. The only continuity was the
easel by the window: the Messiah was still an enthusiastic artist.
The question that really set him on fire was this: 'Is it a joy or a
burden to be the Christ?' I asked.
Vissarion paused, and then laughed. Instantly, the atmosphere
changed and he began to elaborate upon how difficult it was to
be the Messiah, but at the same time, he had no choice. It was
necessary to suffer so that he could understand the pain in the
hearts of men. And now, the Son of God could not be stopped:
thirty minutes later he was still talking, totally energized,
speaking of the events that would follow the Apocalypse when
the survivors would cast off their bodies and colonize new
planets as spirit beings. Finally I called a halt to the interview:

Dreamland ­ the Community of Vissarion (1)

Vissarion was unlike anybody I had ever met. He was very
charismatic, and I didn't doubt that he was sincere. It was also
impossible to deny that he and his devotees had achieved
impressive things, whether it be building a town on top of a
mountain or growing bananas in Siberia.
The next day however I attended an open air meeting between
Vissarion and the villagers and was shocked by what I heard.
They wanted to know what brands of washing powder were
acceptable to God, and whether it was okay to laugh at dirty
jokes. There was nothing dangerous or surprising in his answers,
but that was the problem. His followers were highly intelligent
people, indeed probably more intelligent than their Saviour.
They should have known the answers already. His divine plan to
make his followers morally perfect was failing: the vast list of
rules in the Last Testament was actually making them infantile,
terrified they weren't fulfilling God's commands accurately. It
was as if having escaped one totalitarian system, they had
decided to embrace another, different one, under the Teacher's
watchful eye.
I left shortly afterwards. And while I never came close to
believing, and it remained a mystery to me why so many
intelligent and capable people accepted Sergei Torop as their
Saviour, I must admit that I am haunted by memories of the
time I spent among the Vissarionites. I often think about the
people I met out there, and wonder how they're doing. I would
like to go back - not to live, just to spend a little more time on the
edge of the End of the World. I hear the mountain calling. Thus
far I have been able to resist.
