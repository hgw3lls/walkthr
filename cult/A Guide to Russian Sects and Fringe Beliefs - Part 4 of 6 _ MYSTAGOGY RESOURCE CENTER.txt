Russian Sects and Fringe Beliefs ­ Part Four: Magical
Services
Moscow, Russia
July 13, 2009
Marc Bennetts
RIA Novosti
The popular image of the Soviet Union is of a grey, monolithic
state where belief in anything that failed to correspond to the
teachings of Marx and Lenin was stamped out by brutal KGB
agents.
However, beneath the secular surface, thousands of healers and
sorcerers went about their age-old professions, practising
ancient traditions that date back to pre-Christian Rus. The
collapse of the Soviet Union saw these widespread beliefs in the
magical and the paranormal rise rapidly to the surface.
From their humble beginnings of whispered recommendations,
“magical services” have made the crossover into the mainstream.
Estimates suggest there are over 100,000 occult practitioners in
Russia, with the business worth some $10 million in Moscow
alone.
The Tainaya Vlast (The Secret Power) semimonthly, with a print
run of 250,000, is Russia’s most popular paper devoted to all
things supernatural. However, if in the West, a similar
newspaper would most likely be filled with adverts for New Age
self-development courses and the like, Tainaya Vlast’s classifieds
are of a much more down-to-earth nature, featuring ads offering
to, among other things, “magically cure alcoholism and resolve
family problems.”

In a nod to the realities of 21st-century urban life, the vast
majority of Russia’s professional occultists have their own
Internet sites. The simply-named Magicheskie Uslugi (Magical
Services) website is just one of them. “Curses - 100 euros,
success in court - 20 euros,” offers the oddly flesh-coloured site,
its pricelist stating that “all services will be fulfilled only after
100% pre-payment.”
The economic downturn that hit Russia hard towards the end of
2008 has also had an effect on the marketing techniques of
modern occult gurus, with many proudly advertising “new antifinancial crisis magic!” Apart from the usual curses and love
spells, many witches and wizards claim to be able to magically
protect their clients against getting the sack by using their
powers on unpleasant bosses, maintain pre-crisis salaries by
bewitching the entire bookkeeping department, and even make
sure that loan applications are approved.

Hypnotist and Psychic healer Alan Chumak

“Casting spells on banks is more expensive, however,” I was told
by the owner of one such business when I called to enquire
further.
Why?
“It involves black magic.”
“We don’t have the right, legally, to use the word magic in our
adverts,” Mikhail, owner of an occult centre in the centre of
Moscow told me. “I took the word magic off our advert and got a

license.”
But why did the word “magic” cause so much offence when, say,
the word “clairvoyant”, was fine?
“Ah, you know,” Mikhail went on. “Those officials. Around five
years ago, there was a weird period, let’s call it a witch-hunt,
when the authorities started cracking down on the whole occult
thing. We came to a compromise, and the word magic got
banned. They had to ban something,” he shrugged.
Mikhail is an ex-Soviet air force pilot who, like many people in
Russia around the time of the breakup of the Soviet Union, got
interested in the occult. However, he differed from most in that
he set up his own business, hiring “people with special gifts” to
work for him.
He was obviously doing well. His premises were plush, in one of
Moscow’s most exclusive areas, and he seemed to have no
shortage of clients.
“People in Russia are far more drawn to magical services than to
psychiatrists or psychoanalysts,” Mikhail said. “They believe
more in miracles than people in the West. And they really love a
show.”

A news report on Anatoliy Kashpirovsky and Alan Chumak

Mikhail introduced me to new employee, psychic healer Olga
who had applied for a position after seeing the center’s program
on a satellite TV channel.
“I came in for an interview, had a test, and they took me on,” she
told me.

I had no interest in exposing Olga as a fraud, and, to be honest, I
was not even sure that she was. She certainly seemed to believe
in her abilities.
“My powers were discovered when I went on holiday with my
school, back in the Soviet era,” Olga told me. “This was the era of
Anatoliy Kashpirovsky, and that lot, and every sanitarium had its
very own bio-energy therapist.”
As the Soviet Union entered its death throes, Kashpirovsky and

his great rival, Alan Chumak, were state-approved psychics who
appeared on national television, curing the nation of various
illnesses through the power of the mind. Able at their height of
their fame to fill stadiums all over the country, their individual
weekly TV shows had the entire country captivated.
Kashpirovsky, clad all in black, his piercing eyes staring into flats
across the USSR, “healed” millions, his sonorous voice both
reassuring and oddly threatening.
“For those of you with high blood pressure, your blood pressure
will lower…whoever has hip injuries, they will heal…” he droned.
Chumak, a white-haired figure for whom the word eccentric
could have been invented, was entirely the opposite. After a brief
matter-of-fact introduction, he would silently and slowly, like
some Soviet Zen master, move his hands for half-an-hour or so,
“charging” with healing energy the jars and saucepans full of
water that his millions of viewers had placed around their flats.

Dr. Kashpirovski healing session

“Anyway,” Olga continued, “I started to feel ill when I went to
one of the bio-energy sessions, and afterwards the psychic told
me that I should never attend again as I had my own powers.”
Had she been frightened, I wondered, by this sudden discovery
of her gift?
“I remember feeling extremely interested,” she smiled. “My
friends didn’t know that much about it, but my parents did. I
used to take my mother’s headaches away.”
Olga also had her own theory as to the popularity of magical
services in Russia.
“It’s much more interesting,” she said. “When you go to a
psychoanalyst, you have to tell him your problems. Here,
psychics and clairvoyants tell you your problems. That’s far, far
better.”
