+=3: A Logical Adventure
Walkthrough

This "game" is meant to illustrate the fact that "logical" and "simple"
puzzles can be made arbitrarily difficult to solve.  In this particular
case, the puzzle exploits an assumption that experienced text adventure
players will make -- that things that aren't listed in one's inventory
aren't actually manipulable game objects.

>give shirt to troll
>give shoes to troll
>give socks to troll

The solution is perfectly logical and simple.  If you were standing on a
bridge with a troll who clearly wanted you to give him something, and you
had nothing to give him, what would you do?  You'd give him the shirt off
your back, of course.

Note that if you say "examine me", you'll see that you are in fact a
clothed human.  (If you'd have been naked, the game certainly would have
pointed this out, right?)

Everything explicitly mentioned in this game except the troll is a red
herring.
