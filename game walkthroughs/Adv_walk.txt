Adventure - Walkthrough
By Julian Fleetwood


This walkthrough is for the 350 point version of Adventure.

At some point in the game a dwarf should show up and throw an axe at you. He will miss and run away. After he leaves type GET AXE and keep it with you all the time. The next time the dwarf shows up keep typing THROW AXE then GET AXE until he's dead (remembering to get the axe afterwards).

A pirate will also show up at some point and steal your treasure. You get all of the stolen items back at the end of this walkthrough, as well as the final treasure, so don't worry unless he steals a treasure you need to solve a puzzle, in which case jump to the end of the walkthrough.
