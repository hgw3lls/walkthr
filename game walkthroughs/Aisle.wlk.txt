                                   --WalkThru--
									   
	 Not really a walkthru; just a list, in alphabetical order, of all
 	 actions which will produce an "ending".  I've produced it for
 	 completeness' sake--if you've had a reasonable number of endings and
	 can't think of anything else to do then the list should help.  PLEASE
	 do not work your way through the list from start to finish before
	 you've really played around with the game.  That would waste my time
	 and yours.

	 Thanks for playing, 

	 Sam.
