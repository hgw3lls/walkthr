1/ General Hints

The dogs will get you after a limited number of moves, so whenever you are
in the open, be sure to take cover (eg climb the tree) frequently in order
to avoid being attacked.  There are 3 hiding places outside the house, one
of which you must arrange yourself.

There is a secret panel in the study which is not indicated in the text.
In the same study, there is a pencil which cannot be lifted.  I think
'pencil' may be a typographical error for 'panel'.  It makes more sense
that the game should tell you about the panel and that you couldn't lift
it.  This basic problem got me stuck for about 5 years!

The combination to the safe must be entered in one string, not as single
characters (eg, enter ABCD not A [ENTER] B [ENTER] C [ENTER] D [ENTER].

The safe combination is IBDF.  This is worked out by the note in the box
which says 'VI', and then the book in the library.  If you start at F, the
sixth (VI) letter and go right 3, you get to the 9th letter, which is I.
Left 7 takes you back to the  second letter (9-7), which is B, and then
right  2 brings you to D (2+2).  The F at the end is our starting letter,
but I am not sure how we are meant to know that it is used at the end,
other than as a starting point.

Now we must escape with the gold - but I don't know how!  Some bells will
ring & skeleton will chase you.  So far I have tried dropping the armour in
the treasure room (thinking that if it goes in the chest, the weight may
equal that of the gold, and prevent the bells from ringing), closing the
chest (which you can't do), collecting the plank to stop the skeleton
crossing the snake pit (which makes no difference), and trying to get to
the garden so the dogs eat his bones! (which there don't seem to be enough
moves to do).


4/ Notes

I was at a flea market a few weekends ago, and I came across a stack of C64
tapes.  One of them was a Computer Classics title, and on the back was a
list of their other games.  There was a host of titles for the VIC 20,
including "The Secret of Bastow Manor".  Underneath the VIC 20 titles was a
list of C64 titles, which was basically everything from the VIC 20 list but
with '64' added to the end.  Therefore the proper title of the C64 version
of this game is "The Secret of Bastow Manor 64"!

This game was probably the second game I ever played on the C64, and my
brother and I spent ages on it, and got quite far - in fact, it was only
the panel puzzle (see above) that got us stuck.  Since we spent so much
time on this game, our father used to ask us all the time if we had solved
the game.  However, he never remembered the name right, so he always asked
us "Have you solved Bristow Manor yet?"  Of course, this became a running
joke between my brother & me and it still is, so I have had lots of good
memories associated with this game.

I spent several "wilderness years" without a C64, until I stumbled on to
C64 emulation, and managed to transfer Bastow Manor to a disk image. After
that, a couple of people helped me on the way, and therefore deserve much
thanks:

Adam Nelson (Spud) - When I came back to the game, I knew what to do, but I
couldn't manage the 'minimalist' sequence needed to avoid the dogs!  Adam
knew how to set up the ladder & get back to the shed safely.

Stuart George (Dark Fiber) - After getting as far as my brother & me had
been before (further even, by one move - I discovered FILL BUCKET!), DF
told me about the hidden panel, then gave me a few other tips.

Your Name Here - Whoever gets past that %$^%$# skeleton!!

David Williams - My brother, for all his help more than a decade ago, plus
for being impressed and encouraging when I discovered FILL BUCKET.

My Dad - I'm looking forward to telling him I solved "Bristow Manor" ;)
