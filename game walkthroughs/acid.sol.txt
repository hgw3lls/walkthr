This here is the solution to Acid Whiplash (acid.z5), by Rybread Celsius
and Cody Sandifer.  The zcode game file can be found on ftp.gmd.de in

/if-archive/games/competition98/inform/acid.

If you haven't already done so, you should probably try

Liquid (games/competition96/liquid/liquid.z5),
Rippled Flesh (games/competition96/ripflesh/ripflesh.z5),
and Symetry (games/competition97/inform/reflect/reflect.z5)

before giving acid.z5 a shot.  Trust me on this one -- it's worth it.

Anyway, here goes:

get scroll.
read it.
w.
push button.

u.
open tip.
i.
open book.
z.z.z.z.z.
punkrock.
s.

drop thread.
break law.
drink puddle.
z. (12 times)
w.w.w.w.n.w.n.w.
z. (15 times)
e.e.e.u.u.u.w.w.

That's it.  Don't forget to hit AMUSING for a list of pleasurable treats.
