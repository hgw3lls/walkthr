             $adventure walkthrough
          rev. by Jessica Allan 08/02/97

This will RUIN the game for you.  Do not use it unless you
are truly desperate to stop playing and get on with your
life.  Since I have documented it quite thoroughly, this
will ruin it more than any other walkthrough, and even 
contains some of the ending.

This is an adaptation of Sean L. Palmer's walkthrough, with 
better documentation and some improvements made.  

These commands will not work in every single game.  There 
are some variants, such as get/take, and this will not work
for the 430 point, 550 point, 660 point, 501 point, 551 
point, or 370 point versions.  That means that the Windows
version does not conform to this, although the documentation
*may* be helpful.  

I highly recommend Rick Adams' page:
http://www.winternet.com/~radams/adventure/
This contains the walkthroughs, tips, history, links to an
FTP site providing source code and compiled versions for 
DOS/Windows, Amiga, Macintosh, OS/2, and UNIX, and maps.
Even with this documentation, you can *still* get lost due 
to some contingencies in the game, such as backtracking to
compensate for piracy, dwarves, and a few other things.

For those reasons, you cannot feed this through input 
redirection, although, if you're astute enough, you could 
probably write some mild AI code and feed this through.  But
I doubt anyone would bother.

I can guarantee that this version will work with Adventure
on the Web at Stanford's machine:
http://tjwww.stanford.edu/adventure.html
That is the version I tested it with, and I have kept the
original format that was used, such as five letter packing
and such that was output from the other machine.  How close
this is to the original version, I can't say.
I recommend the Web version if you're running a 14.4 
connection or higher, since the Windows version is a bit
outdated anyway.

Enjoy playing, and I'm sorry I had to do this to you.  But
if it wasn't for this walkthrough, I never would have gotten
on with *my* life.  :)
