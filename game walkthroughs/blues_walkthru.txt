Tinseltown Blues walkthrough - by Eytan Zweig
---------------------------------------------

Note - this is a no-frills walkthrough of "Tinseltown Blues". It was written
for version 1.1. 

This walkthrough only gives the commands necessary to solve the puzzles. It is 
not an optimal solution, but it works well within the time limit. It ignores 
several non-essential aspects of the game. It also ignores alternate solutions
to some of the puzzles, which may be more efficient and/or give more points.

On the other hand, I tried to group the actions together into the relevant 
chunks, so it's more-or-less clear why you're doing what you're doing. This 
means that following this solution will involve some back-tracking; but it 
should be useful to people who want help with specific sections of the game 
without necessarily spoiling others. To help facilitate this, in each section
I say where I start for - so people not following the walkthrough from 
beginning to end will know where to begin from.

Note that some sections of the game require others to have been played first, 
but others do not. If you need specific items from other sections, I will 
say so. 

A final, but important note, is that one section of the game (the Cooper 
building) must be  played between 11:45 am and 1:15 pm. If you miss that 
period, you won't be able to get the password for Mrs. Padderwacker's desk, 
which is randomly determined each game.
