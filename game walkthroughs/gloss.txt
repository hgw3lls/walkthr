Anchorhead Glossary
“Why a glossary?”
Many university professors and New York Times writers like to flaunt their superior vocabularies in an effort to appear more intellectual than they really are.  IF writers tend to do the same, but at least they have something productive to show for it.
The problem is that most of us yokels end up having a hard time playing through a game or enjoying it as much as we could, due to the use of words far above the average reading level.  That is all the more true in this case, because not everybody who enjoys Anchorhead (or should) has read Lovecraft.  Along the way of creating a playthrough and putting it into a quasi-professional package, I realized that a glossary would probably be necessary.
To help prevent spoilers, I sorted the entries according to the order you encounter the words, not alphabetically.  One more thing is that the same word might be listed more than once (“Vanity,” for example).  That is because such words have more than one meaning, and each of those meanings are used in their respective contexts within the story.
