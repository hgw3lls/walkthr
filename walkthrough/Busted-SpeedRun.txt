The following is a transcript of a speed run through the interactive fiction
title "Busted" using the fewest number of turns possible.  It relies heavily on
knowledge from previous sessions, implied actions at no cost, and the fact that
an action with multiple objects counts as a single turn.  The final score is
158 points out of a possible 154, in 161 turns.
