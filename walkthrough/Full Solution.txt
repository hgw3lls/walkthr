Full Solution for Acorn Adventure
---------------------------------
Your mission: To wander around the Acorn Offices and escape with 4 Acorn items.

You start by the Reception Desk, there's nothing here, so go N and find yourself in
the Managing Directors Office (strange place for it!). Sitting here is a Distribution
Contract. GET DISTRIBUTION CONTRACT and leave by going W. We find ourselves in the
Customer Support Department. GET BASIC2 SOURCE CODE and go back to the MD's office, by
going E. Now leave by taking the N exit.

Now we are in the Secretary's Office, GET U.S. DEALER BUSINESS CARD. There is nothing
else of importance here, so continue N to find yourself in the Word Processing
Department. There is a Torch here, for those of you who remember back to the early 80's
the Torch was a Z80 computer, running CP/M. EXAMINE TORCH to find out a password. (For
amusement value, GET TORCH and LIGHT TORCH).

Leave the department by going W to the canteen. GET CUP OF COFFEE and then go back E,
and then E again and we find outselves in the Public Relations Department. We don't
want to do anything here just at the moment, so leave by going N.

Now we find ourselves in the Export Department with Herman Hauser (one of the creators
of the BBC Micro) Bearing in mind he probably wants to know about exporting the BBC to
the US we can GIVE U.S. DEALER BUSINESS CARD, and off goes Herman to look for his
business partner. For the moment we don't want to explore the rest of the area, so go
back S, GET 'ACORN USER' PRESS CARD', and then S again.

Here we see Chris Curry (the other creator of the BBC). Take the E exit (Chris won't
stop us as we're certified members of the press!) We find ourselves in the Prototype
Laboratory. GET TELETEXT ADAPTOR and DROP 'ACORN USER' PRESS CARD (as we don't need it
anymore!) then go back W and then S to the Quality Control Department. EXAMINE EPROM
ERASER and GET BLANK EPROM. Return to the Export Department (N, N, N)

Continue onto the N to the Mail Order Department, leave the Spade for now and go W.
GET POWER PILL, EAT POWER PILL. The Pill was a bit hard to swallow, so wash it down
with DRINK CUP OF COFFEE. Now continue W. Here we are in the Showroom with Snapper
(Acorn's version of Pac Man) here. As we have already eaten the Power Pill Snapper won't
stop us continuing. So go S.

We find ourselves in the Marketing Office, here is Sheridan Williams (I presume Acorn's
Marketting Manager at the time!) He probably wants a contract of sorts (Marketting
people are so easily pleased!) OFFER DISTRIBUTION CONTRACT and he'll go away.

Go W and we find ourselves in the Software Support Department, there is a PROM BLOWER
here, and look, we have all the components of a BASIC2 ROM. So BLOW BASIC2 ROM, GET
BASIC2 ROM and finally, DROP BASIC2 SOURCE CODE (not needed anymore!).

Leave and return to the Mail Order Department (E, N, E, E) GET SPADE and return to the
Secretary's Office (S, S, W, S) Continue on to the W and we find ourselves in a Room
with Scaffolding. Hold on; does this remind you of the dame 'Dig Dug'? Hmmm. DIG SPADE
and the Monster falls into the Hole! DROP SPADE and head W. In the Warehouse is an
Electron ready to ship. GET ELECTRON.

Now Return to the Export Department (E, E, N, E, N) and head E to the Despatch Bay.
GET ECONET INTERFACE. Now we have all four items and need to escape! How about the
Rear Exit? Go there (W, N, W) The exit to the North is blocked off by a voice activated
lock. But we got a password from the Torch, so SAY 6502 and Huzzah! we have won!
