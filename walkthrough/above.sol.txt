Above and Beyond" solution by pjg 
This is not the "official" solution 
Feel free to write and upload a better solution 
if you want to do so, otherwise, corrective modifications 
to this solution are welcomed and encouraged. 

6/16/2000 - MjS - Added 2 alternate puzzle solutions, noted 
scoring bug (fixed in 1.1) and added to amusing list. 
Good job, PJG. 

6/20/2000 - pjg - corrected cumulative point totals for version 1.1 

For game version 1.0 or 1.1 
Other game versions may be slightly different. 

This game is very linear and a lot of snooping around 
is required to solve it. Knowledge of future events 
is required for some of the puzzles. 
Examine and Search do different things. 
If you get stuck then consult the relevant 
section of the solution for help. 
Also, this game has the very nice "Winnable" command 
and some built in hints. 
  
Save game files are named according to the score. 

Takes about 600 moves. 
Comments and points are in ()
